**Description**

This document uses Linear Discriminant Analysis for classifying beningn and malignant tumors. Due to the scope of this assigment, this study ignores the examination and critical evaluation of LDA assumptions of multivariate normality, homoscedasticity (covariance matrix) and multicollinearity. 

**Prerequisites**

- Download the dataset "data.csv"
- Install libraries "rmarkdown", "reshape2", "ggplot2", "corrplot", "ROCR", "caret"
